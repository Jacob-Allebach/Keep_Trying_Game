# Keep Trying!
## What is the game?
Keep trying is a turn-based combat rogue-like game developed using the Twine 2 tool in the browser. The goal of the game is to grow stronger by defeating enemies and boosting your stats in order to prevent Inevita-Bill from destroying the past, present, and future. There are 17 different enemies to vanquish and several other events that are encountered in between some battles. With three starting classes to choose from, many items and spells to equip, and custom-made sprites for each enemy, I am happy with how this game turned out. Though I am not continuing to develop this game, it was a very good learning experience to use a tool like this to create a decently fleshed out game.

## How to download and play
Because of the way Twine 2 saves games, the entire game is held within the HTML file in this repository. To play it, all you need to do is download the file and open it in your browser. In order to have all of the sprites and backgrounds for the game, you will need to have an internet connection as it is pulling those images off of a Twitter account that I made for this exact purpose. I hope you enjoy!
